## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - BootStrap
  - JavaScript

  ### What I learned

  While this challenge looked easy when I first looked at athe question, I faced a lot of problems in aligning the 
  elements of the website. All the properties i.e padding, margin, position all confused me while working on this project. This showed me that I need to work on some CSS prperties.

  ### Useful resources

  - [Example resource 1](https://www.getbootstrap.com) - This helped me create a responsive webpage based on the device. 
  - [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me relearn the aligning properties in CSS and apply them in this project.
